# servers-for-react-native

These are servers used for the Course I took on Udemy.

branch jsonserver is for https://github.com/lesmanadel/blog-react-native
branch track-server is for https://github.com/lesmanadel/tracks-react-native
Course Link https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course

This project is pretty much the same without any customization. Just for safekeeping and own learning refrence.
